Hi, Nice to meet you. I'm Jon.

People ask me questions about information security. If you have quetions, send me a message.

Things I do:

- Learn
- Product managment
- Startup security
- Development
- Infrastructure
- Management
- Compliance
- Procurment
- Vendor management
- ISO 27001, SOC1, SOC2
- Big Bank Security Requirements
- Data Flow Diagrams
- Network Security
- AWS
- Risk assessment
- Contract review


With two decades of experience, I still spend a lot of time learning from the people I work with, companies I work for, and the information security community.

Two fun facts about me:

1. I have 4 amazing kids, 3 girls and 1 boy.
2. I cannot get enough snowboarding, rock climbing, and mountain biking.
